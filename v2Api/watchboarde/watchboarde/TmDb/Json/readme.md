generate c# classes for the json in this file and include the JsonPropertyName attribute on all properties.
also include the Serializable attribute on all of the classes.
for any classes that don't have an "Id" or "id" property, add an Id property that is a Guid and defaults to Guid.NewGuid().
combine the generated classes into one file.
